# Tenzies — Game (React Edition)

**This the first capstone project from [scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e) plateform (react basics course) instructor Bob Ziroll**
A fast, minimalist implementation of the classic **Tenzies** dice game, built with **React** and deployed to **Netlify**. Roll the dice, hold the values you want to keep, and race to get all dice showing the same number.

## About


Tenzies is a casual dice game that's perfect for quick play sessions. This project focuses on clean UI, responsive behavior, and simple game logic that’s easy to follow and extend.

**Why this project?**

- Practice React hooks and component composition
- Demonstrate state management and derived game state
- Provide a compact, production-ready example you can deploy and customize

---

## Rules

1. Click **Roll** to roll all dice.
2. Click any die to **hold** its value (held dice don’t change when rolling).
3. Keep rolling until **all dice show the same number** and are **held** — that’s **Tenzies!**
4. Optionally track **number of rolls** and **elapsed time** for an extra challenge.
